**Heart Attack Risk Analysis**

**Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday2/heart-attack-prediction-in-united-states

Synthetic patient health and lifestyle data with demographics, vitals, and risk factors

**SQL Scripts**
Cleaned and explored the datatset in **PostgreSQL**
Queries include:
  - Average cholesterol in patients with vs without history of heart attacks
  - % of Male vs. Female with heart attacks
  - Age group prevelance (30-39, 40-49, etc.)
  - Lifestyle patterns: smoking, drinking, activity level

**Exploration in Excel**
  - Compared average cholesterol and blood pressure by risk factor
  - Calculated prevalence by gender and age group
  - Explored lifestyle vs heart attack outcomes

**Tableau Dashboard**
  
  -Includes:
    
    - Smoking & Drinking impact
    - Gender split
    - Age group breakdown
    - BMI and blood pressure thresholds

**Key Insights**
  - **Smoking is a stronger predictor than drinking** - smokers had consistently higher heart attack rates, non-smokers moderate drinkers showed the lowest risk.
  - **Obesity (BMI > 30) and High blood pressure (>140)** are linked to higher prevelance, confirming known cardiovascular risks
  - **Ages 60-69** showed a slight increase in risk compared to other groups, even though the dataset is relatively balanced
